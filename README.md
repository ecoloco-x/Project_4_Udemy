## Data Exploration

Regression analysis on (scatter)
  - price vs number of subsribers 
  - price vs number of subsribers vs duration since published (3D charts)
  - rating vs course duration / number of lecturs
  - rating vs num subscribers
  - multi var - number of sub, number of lectures and content duration
  - linear - number of coursers per year
  - bar - histograms of content duration,
  - bar- histogram year published
  - boxplot - duration,
  - violin- n_lectures
  - pie- levels 
  - radar - price, n-subscribers, n-rating, duration, number_lecturs
   
  - multiple series charts... 
    - year vs price category (categorise the prices)(grouped)
    - level vs price categories (stacked)
   
  - if time... analyse course names, via string and count and then do bubble plot to show frequency, - or bar chart for simplification
